    | Process  |   Arrival Time | Burst Time  |

    |    p1    |      0.0       |       8     |
    |    p2    |      0.4       |       4     |

a. What is the average turnaround time for these processes with the FCFS scheduling algorithm?
b. What is the average turnaround time for these processes with the SJF scheduling algorithm?
c. Compute what average turnaround time will be if the CPU is left idle for the first 1 unit and then SJF scheduling is used. Remember        that processes P1 and P2 are waiting during this idle time, so their waiting time may increase.
